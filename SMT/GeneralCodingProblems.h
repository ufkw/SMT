// Our SMT coding exercise is below. There are three methods that need to be filled out.  
// There are descriptions for each method (pay close attention to the return values), as well as the 
// method prototypes. You should use C++ to implement the methods and any testing you deem appropriate.
// Take as much time as you need and send back the completed file(s) once you are finished, as well 
// as any console output of the results of your testing.

// Imagine a camera pointed straight down at a field. We would like to figure out how far off the
// ground the camera needs to be in order to see the entire field within the camera's field of
// view. For this problem, imagine the simple 2D problem as illustrated below. Don't worry about
// the camera's orientation or the difference between horizontal field of view and vertical field
// of view. Suppose that covering the length of the field is also sufficient for 
// covering the width of the field. Your objective is to fill-out the skeleton function called 
// FindCameraHeight. The inputs to the function are the length of the field and the camera's known
// field of view (in degrees). The output will be your computed camera height (given in the same units
// as the field length). You should use the return value to flag inappropriate inputs.

// compute the distance along the ground plane between the camera and where the camera is looking.
// To do this, imagine that the camera's center of projection and principal point are aligned and

// along the ground plane. You should use the return value to flag inappropriate inputs.

// A batter located at the origin has hit a baseball and we would like to figure out if the ball
// was hit well enough to fly over the outfield wall for a home run. You should imagine the 2D

// second), the launch angle up away from the horizon (in degrees), and the height of the outfield
// wall (in "units"). The givens are that the ball was contacted 3 units off of the ground, the
// outfield wall is located 400 units from the origin, and that there is a downward force of 32.2
// units per second squared. The output is a single boolean flag denoting whether the ball will be
// a home run. You should use the return value to flag inappropriate inputs.
